Issues: 
    I had some issues but also have 3 kids at home and getting pretty frustrated with them at the moment... 
        1) date is a little weird - not done totally correctly but there IS a date option... 
        2) not getting answers to show up, keep getting the error "TypeError addAnswer is not a function" which is
        similar to errors I had before but running out of time to fix before the deadline
        3) voting not working - I started adding in the functionality, but due to issue #2, I need answers posted first before I 
        can fix the voting issue :( 

            Well before turning in the project, I went to add a question just checking all the working 
            functionality, and now thats messed up too, and showing up blank,
            even though it worked yesterday :( I'm so frustrated and not sure when/where it broke. I swear the db was
            working perfectly and now getting empty arrays. I tried to roll back the git commits on another branch but it still wouldn't work.
            All I had left was fixing answers and votes and I'm so dissapointed :(
