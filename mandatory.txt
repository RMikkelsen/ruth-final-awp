Issues: 
    There's a few here but I have 3 kids at home and getting pretty frustrated with them... 
        1) date is a little weird
        2) not getting answers to show up, keep getting the error "TypeError addAnswer is not a function" which is
        similar to errors I had before but running out of time to fix before the deadline
        3) voting not working - I started adding in the functionality, but due to issue #2, I need answers posted first before I 
        can fix the voting issue :(
